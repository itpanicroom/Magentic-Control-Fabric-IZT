## Overview
The Magen­tic Control Fabric (MCF) defines a governance architecture where every action—human or automated—is a verifiable, reversible intent.  
It extends traditional Zero Trust from *who* and *what* to **why** an action occurs: **Intent Zero Trust**

---

## Key Contributions
1. **Dual-Intent Architecture** – merges human and automation intent under shared verification.  
2. **Intent Zero Trust (IZT)** – extends “never trust, always verify” to purpose itself.  
3. **Three Laws of Magen­tic Governance**:
      1. no automation without intent
      2. no intent without audit
      3. every audit must enable accountability 
5. **Defensive Back Shield** – compliance engine for fairness, bias, and risk parsing.
